We recently started working on a project called `code/Clone`.

This is not a side project we picked for trends or hype. It is a deliberate learning project with a simple goal: build something real, ship it, and let the process teach us what theory alone cannot.

The idea is straightforward. We take a product pattern we respect, rebuild the core experience from scratch, and document what we learn while doing it.

Why do this?

Because most technical learning stays shallow until you are forced to make hard tradeoffs.

Reading about architecture is useful. Designing architecture when requirements change every week is different. Watching tutorials about scalability is useful. Debugging a slow path in your own stack at midnight is different. Memorizing patterns is useful. Choosing one pattern, living with its consequences, and refactoring when it hurts is where understanding becomes real.

`code/Clone` is our way to force that depth.

We are using this project to get better at three things:

1. Building with constraints instead of perfect assumptions.
2. Making decisions with incomplete information.
3. Turning messy implementation pain into reusable engineering judgment.

There is also a second reason this project matters: clarity.

A lot of teams move fast but skip reflection. Features ship, but lessons get lost. We want the opposite. We want each phase of `code/Clone` to leave behind clear reasoning: what we tried, what failed, what worked, and why.

That is the real output, not just code.

So this post is the starting marker.

We are building `code/Clone` to learn in public, to sharpen our craft through real constraints, and to turn each technical decision into long-term leverage.

That is what we are doing.

And that is why.
